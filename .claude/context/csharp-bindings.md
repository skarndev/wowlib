# C#/.NET bindings (welder-csharp rod)

Read when: touching `bindings/csharp/`, the `weld` annotations, or any
`wowlib::lang::cs` site.

## The rod is an out-of-tree welder extension now (2026-08)

The C# rod was extracted from welder's `feature/csharp` branch into its own
repo, https://github.com/skarndev/welder-csharp; welder is pinned at **main**
again. `cmake/Dependencies.cmake` declares both: `welder_csharp` is
MakeAvailable'd only under `WOWLIB_BUILD_CSHARP`, and because our welder is
populated first, its `if(NOT TARGET welder::headers)` guard uses our pin
rather than fetching its own. The subproject defines
`welder_csharp_generate_bindings()` globally — no `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH` dance.

## Language identity: `wowlib::lang::cs`

welder's core no longer names C# (`welder::lang` holds only `py`/`lua`; the
old `welder::lang::cs` spelling does not compile). The rod mints its identity
from welder's open user range (`user_lang<WELDER_CSHARP_LANG_SLOT>`, default
slot 0) as `welder::rods::csharp::cs`. wowlib **respells the same identity**
in `src/wowlib/core/lang.hpp` as `wowlib::lang::cs` (`user_lang<0>`), so core
headers never include rod headers — they must parse in Python-only builds
where welder-csharp is not even fetched. The two spellings must stay
bit-for-bit equal: if the rod's slot is ever re-pointed, re-point ours.

## The language-agnostic weld convention

Every welded entity carries a **bare** `[[=welder::weld]]` — an empty language
mask means "all languages", any rod included. Only **marks** may name a
language, and only where the reason is genuinely language-specific. The `cs`
sites in the tree today:

- `mark::only(welder::lang::lua, wowlib::lang::cs)` on the 12 per-version
  `read`/`write` fs-I/O methods (WMO, M2, Skeleton, ADT, WDT, WDL). Python
  attaches an equivalent surface to the version-agnostic bases from
  hand-written glue; Lua and C# take the direct methods.
- `weld_as(wowlib::lang::cs, ...)` on two C#-only naming collisions the rod
  diagnoses at generation: `SMTextureColorGrading::_04` → `Unknown04` (leading
  underscore survives PascalCase and collides with the generated `_h_*`
  scaffolding namespace), and `SMOFog::Fog` → `FogBand` (CS0102: a nested type
  and the `fog` member both style to `Fog`).

There are **no `mark::exclude(cs)` sites left**: the previously-unmarshallable
shapes (`vector<vector<T>>`, `vector<array<T,N>>`, `vector<string>`) and the
flattened-base `read`/`write` overload collision were all fixed in the rod
before the extraction, and the excludes were dropped. The whole C++ API binds.

## ClientDB tables are on the C# surface

`bindings/csharp/surface.hpp` includes `<wowlib/db/tables/all.hpp>` — a
dbdgen-emitted umbrella over every generated table header (language-neutral:
nothing but includes; `emit_all_tables` in tools/dbdgen). The CMake block
links `wowlib_db_tables` (include root) and adds explicit `add_dependencies`
on `wowlib_dbdgen` for both the generator and shim targets, since an INTERFACE
link alone does not order compilation after header generation.

## Shim sharding (what unblocked the DB-bearing build)

One shim TU over formats + ~1200 tables x all eras does not compile in real
time/memory. `welder_csharp_generate_bindings(... SHARDS N)` splits the shim
into `shim.0.cpp … shim.N-1.cpp` that compile in parallel; each top-level
class's thunks land whole in one shard, so the split is always link-correct.

- `WOWLIB_CS_SHARDS` (cache var, default 32). Unlike the Python db shards,
  every C# shard includes `surface.hpp` **whole**, so each shard pays the full
  frontend parse — that redundancy is why the default sits well below
  `WOWLIB_DB_SHARDS`' 96.
- All shim TUs plus the generator TU run in the `wowlib_py_compile` job pool
  (the RAM-bounded Ninja pool, computed at the top of bindings/CMakeLists.txt
  outside both backend blocks).
- SHARDS > 1 contract: the welded headers are included by several TUs, so
  namespace-scope function definitions must be `inline` (ordinary header ODR
  rule; wowlib headers already satisfy it — they compile into many Python TUs).

## Result<T> is the exception channel

`Result<T>` (`std::expected<T, Error>`) does **not** surface as a result
object. The rod peels the expected: the value branch crosses as plain `T`, the
error branch throws through the `welder_error` slot every thunk carries.
welder renders the error text through ADL `to_string(e)` first — `wowlib::Error`
has one.

## Build shape

```bash
cmake -S . -B build/csharp -G Ninja -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-16 \
  -DWOWLIB_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DWOWLIB_BUILD_CSHARP=ON
cmake --build build/csharp --target wowlib_cs
```

- `WOWLIB_BUILD_CSHARP` (default OFF) gates both the welder-csharp fetch and
  `bindings/CMakeLists.txt`'s C# block.
- **No .NET SDK is needed to build.** The rod is pure reflection→text;
  `dotnet` is only needed to *consume* the emitted `Bindings.cs`.
- Artifacts in `build/csharp/bindings/csharp/`: `shim.<i>.cpp` (compiled into
  `libwowlib_native.dylib`) and `Bindings.cs`.
- `bindings/csharp/surface.hpp` is the single header BOTH the generator and
  the generated shim reflect, so the TUs cannot see different declarations. It
  pulls the per-range welded alias tables from `bindings/instantiations/`
  (bindings root — language-neutral, shared by all backends) plus the db
  umbrella.

## Local toolchain notes

- macOS/arm64, gcc-16 + .NET 10 SDK. welder-csharp's cookbook/test csproj
  files default to `net8.0`; with only the .NET 10 runtime installed a
  `net8.0` app fails to launch — target `net10.0` (or install the 8.0
  runtime).
